Currently, the following platforms are supported: JVM Android iOS ARM64/x64 macOS x64 watchOS ARM64/x86 tvOS ARM64/x64 Version Requirements \u00b6 Important Your project's Kotlin compiler version must match the version used by Island Time. Due to the experimental status of inline classes , which are used in Island Time's public API, the version of Kotlin that you use in your project must match the version used by Island Time -- even for non-native targets. Those of you who are using Kotlin/Native are probably already accustomed to dealing with this since there is no binary compatibility between releases yet. Island Time Version Kotlin Version 0.1.x 1.3.6x 0.2.x 1.3.7x Kotlin 1.4 preview builds Island Time builds that are compatible with the latest Kotlin 1.4 preview build are also available starting with 1.4-M3. Just add the appropriate suffix to the version number. For example, 0.2.3 would be 0.2.3-1.4-M3 . JVM \u00b6 Island Time requires Java 8 or above. Android \u00b6 Island Time requires a minimum compile SDK of API 15 or later and Java 8 support should be turned on . Gradle Setup \u00b6 Common \u00b6 Add the following dependency to your project's Gradle script: Groovy dependencies { implementation \"io.islandtime:core:0.2.3\" } Kotlin dependencies { implementation ( \"io.islandtime:core:0.2.3\" ) } Note Island Time publishes Gradle Module Metadata for all multiplatform artifacts. The listed \"common\" artifacts may be used in the dependency block of any target, common or platform-specific. Extensions are also available for serialization and the @Parcelize feature on Android. Android \u00b6 Android Studio 4.0 or later \u00b6 Make sure that core library desugaring is enabled.

Times \u00b6 Island Time has a wide array of different date-time classes, each tailored to its own set of use cases. These classes model the date and timekeeping system defined in ISO-8601 , the international standard for the exchange of dates and times. The ISO standard applies the present-day Gregorian calendar proleptically , which is to say, even to the time period before it was adopted . Date Representations \u00b6 Class Precision Example ISO Representation Date day 2020-02-15 YearMonth month 2020-02 Year year 2020 The Date class represents a date in an ambiguous region. It could be in New York City. It could be in Tokyo. The instants in time that define the start and end of a Date can only be determined in the context of a particular time zone \u2014 hence the ambiguous part. // Get the current date in the local time zone of the system val today = Date . now () // Create a date from components val leapDay = Date ( 2020 , Month . February , 29 ) // Parse a date from ISO string representation val cincoDeMayo = \"2020-05-05\" . toDate () It's also possible to represent a date with reduced precision. For example, a YearMonth could be used to represent a credit card expiration date containing just a year and month. // Create a year-month from a year and month val expiration = YearMonth ( year , month ) // A year-month can also be built using the \"at\" operator val yearMonth : YearMonth = Year ( 2020 ) at Month . AUGUST Time of Day \u00b6 The Time class can be used to represent a time of the day in an ambiguous region. Unlike Date , there are no classes with reduced precision \u2014 a Time is always precise to the nanosecond. // Get the current time in the local time zone of the system val currentTime = Time . now () // Create a time from components val time = Time ( 13 , 59 , 59 , 999 _999_999 ) // Destructure a time back into components val ( hour , minute , second , nanosecond ) = time Combined Date and Time of Day \u00b6 A DateTime combines a Date and Time , allowing you to represent both in a single data structure, still in an ambiguous region. // Create a date-time from individual date and time components val dateTime = DateTime ( 2020 , Month . JANUARY , 21 , 1 , 0 ) // Destructure a date-time val ( date , time ) = dateTime val date = Date ( 2019 , Month . MARCH , 15 ) // The \"at\" operator can also be used to create a date-time val anotherDateTime : DateTime = date at Time . NOON // Or you could get the date-time at midnight from a date val startOfDay : DateTime = date . startOfDay There's no guarantee that a particular DateTime will exist in every time zone and it could even exist twice, all thanks to the fun that is daylight savings time. We'll get into that more shortly, but it's important to keep this in mind since constructing or manipulating a DateTime directly can lead to subtle bugs. Instants in Time \u00b6 The classes we've looked at so far model dates and times in an ambiguous region, but often we want to unambiguously capture an instant in time. There are actually three different classes in Island Time that can do this, each serving a different purpose. Class Description Instant A timestamp ZonedDateTime A date and time of day in a particular time zone OffsetDateTime A date and time of day with fixed UTC offset An Instant is simply a number of seconds and nanoseconds that have elpased since the Unix epoch ( 1970-01-01T00:00Z ), ignoring leap seconds. There's no concept of \"date\" without conversion to one of the other types. Practically speaking, this is the class you should use when you don't care about the local time and just want a UTC timestamp. data class DogDto ( val name : String , val breed : String , // Capture the current system time val creationTime : Instant = Instant . now () ) To capture an instant along with the local time, you have two options \u2014 OffsetDateTime and ZonedDateTime . Both store a date-time with an offset from UTC, however, ZonedDateTime is also aware of time zone rules, which is an important distinction. UtcOffset vs. TimeZone \u00b6 In Island Time, a UtcOffset is just a number of seconds that a local time must be adjusted forward or backward by to be equivalent to UTC. A TimeZone defines the rules used to determine the UTC offset. Time zones fall into two categories \u2014 region-based ( TimeZone.Region ) and fixed offset ( TimeZone.FixedOffset ). Region-based zones have identifiers, such as \"America/New_York\" or \"Europe/London\", that correspond to entries in the IANA Time Zone Database . Fixed offset zones have a fixed UTC offset. While region-based zones are generally preferrable, a suitable one may not exist in all situations and sometimes you just want a fixed offset. ZonedDateTime vs. OffsetDateTime \u00b6 Most platforms nowadays draw their understanding of time zones from the IANA Time Zone Database , but time zones and their rules change all the time and different systems might have different versions of the database or only a subset of it available. This makes persistance and serialization of ZonedDateTime troublesome since there's the possibility that when it gets read later, the zone can't be found or its rules have changed, thus altering the local date and time. Using OffsetDateTime guarantees that you won't get an exception and the value you save will be the value that's read later, making it well-suited for this particular use case. More often than not though, you should use ZonedDateTime since it will handle daylight savings transitions correctly when doing calendrical calculations. You just might want to consider converting to an OffsetDateTime when you persist or serialize your data. val date = Date ( 2020 , Month . MARCH , 8 ) val time = Time ( 2 , 30 ) val zone = TimeZone ( \"America/New_York\" ) // 2:00 on March 8 marks the beginning of daylight savings time on the east // coast of the United States, so 2:30 doesn't exist. The time is automatically // adjusted by an hour to 3:30. val zonedDateTime = date at time at zone println ( zonedDateTime ) // Output: 2020-03-08T03:30-04:00 [America/New_York] // If we subtract an hour, the offset will revert to that of standard time println ( zonedDateTime - 1. hours ) // Output: 2020-03-08T01:30-05:00 [America/New_York] // It's easy to convert a ZonedDateTime to an OffsetDateTime println ( zonedDateTime . asOffsetDateTime ()) // Output: 2020-03-08T03:30-04:00 // It's also possible to change the time zone such that it uses a fixed offset // instead of \"America/New_York\", making it functionally equivalent to an // OffsetDateTime. println ( zonedDateTime . withFixedOffsetZone ()) // Output: 2020-03-08T03:30-04:00 // Or change the zone while preserving the captured instant println ( zonedDateTime . adjustedTo ( TimeZone ( \"America/Los_Angeles\" ))) // Output: 2020-03-07T23:30-08:00 Patterns and Operators \u00b6 Throughout Island Time's date-time primitives, you'll find a set of patterns that remain (relatively) constant as well as a number of operators that simplify common tasks. at \u00b6 The at infix function can be used to build up date-time primitives from \"smaller\" pieces. For example, we can create a DateTime by combining a Date and a Time`. val dateTime = Date . now () at Time . NOON We can then turn that into a ZonedDateTime by combining it with a TimeZone . val zonedDateTime = dateTime at TimeZone . systemDefault () copy() \u00b6 Similar to Kotlin's data classes, each date-time primitive has a copy() method available, making it easy to create a copy while changing any number of properties. val dateTime = DateTime . now (). copy ( dayOfMonth = 15 ) val dateTimeAtMidnight = dateTime . copy ( time = Time . MIDNIGHT ) Addition and Subtraction \u00b6 A duration of time can be added or subtracted from a date-time primitive. Which units are supported will vary depending on whether the primitive is date-based, time-based, or both. val tomorrow = Date . now () + 1. days val yesterday = Date . now () - 1. days val tenSecondsLater = Instant . now () + 10. seconds When working with ZonedDateTime , adding a day-based period of time may cross a daylight savings time transition, in which case, adding 1.days may not be the same as adding 24.hours . Start and end of time periods \u00b6 Relative to any date-based primitive, it's possible to get the start or end of a given period, be it the year, month, week, or day. val date = Date . now () val startOfYear = date . startOfYear val endOfYear = date . endOfYear val startOfMonth = date . startOfMonth val startOfDay : DateTime = date . startOfDay When it comes to weeks, we need to consider which day represents the start of the week. According to the ISO standard, that's Monday. However, depending on the locale, that may be on Sunday or Saturday instead. WeekSettings and the platform Locale type can be used to provide control over this. // Start of ISO week (Monday start) val isoStart = Date . now (). startOfWeek // Start of week using Sunday as start val sundayStart = Date . now (). startOfWeek ( WeekSettings . SUNDAY_START ) // Respect the user's system settings (usually, most appropriate) val systemStart = Date . now (). startOfWeek ( WeekSettings . systemDefault ()) // Use the default associated with a particular locale val localeStart = Date . now (). startOfWeek ( explicitLocale ) You can also get the week period as a range or interval . // Get the date range of the current week val weekRange : DateRange = Date . now (). weekRange ( WeekSettings . systemDefault ()) Previous or next day of week \u00b6 To get, say, the previous Tuesday from a particular date-time, you can do something like this: val now = ZonedDateTime . now () // Get the Tuesday before \"now\" at the same time of day val nowOnTuesday = now . previous ( TUESDAY ) // Get the Tuesday before \"now\" or \"now\" if it already falls on a Tuesday val nowOnTuesdayOrSame = now . previousOrSame ( TUESDAY ) Similarly, you can use next() or nextOrSame() to get the next day of the week relative to the current date. val today = Date . now () val nextWednesday = today . next ( WEDNESDAY ) val nextWednesdayOrToday = today . nextOrSame ( WEDNESDAY ) Rounding \u00b6 A time or date-time can be rounded up, down, or half-up to the precision of a particular unit or increment. val dateTime = DateTime . now () // Output: 2020-06-30T06:32:14.168 // Round half-up to the nearest minute val roundedToMinute = dateTime . roundedTo ( MINUTES ) // Output: 2020-06-30T06:32 // Round half-up to the nearest 15 minutes val roundedToNearest15Mins = dateTime . roundedToNearest ( 15. minutes ) // Output: 2020-06-30T06:30 // Round up to the nearest hour val roundedUpToHour = dateTime . roundedUpTo ( HOURS ) // Output: 2020-06-30T07:00 // Round down to the nearest hour val roundedDownToHour = dateTime . truncatedTo ( HOURS ) // Output: 2020-06-30T06:00 // Round down to the nearest 100 milliseconds val roundedDownTo100Millis = dateTime . roundedDownToNearest ( 100. milliseconds ) // Output: 2020-06-30T06:32:14.1 ISO Representation \u00b6 Any date-time primitive can be converted to an appropriate ISO string format by simply calling toString() . To convert a string into a date-time primitive, use the appropriate conversion function, such as String.toDate() or String.toInstant() . val date = Date . now () val isoString : String = date . toString val dateFromString : Date = isoString . toDate () By default, Island Time reads and writes using ISO-8601 extended format, which is most common. Predefined parsers are also available that can handle other formats.","title":"Dates and Times"},{"location":"basics/dates-and-times/#dates-and-times","text":"Island Time has a wide array of different date-time classes, each tailored to its own set of use cases.

Below are some examples: // Parse an extended format date-time val extendedDateTime = \"2020-12-31T13:45\" . toDateTime () // Parse a basic format date-time val basicDateTime = \"20201231T1345\" . toDateTime ( DateTimeParsers . Basic . DATE_TIME ) // Parse an ordinal date (year and day of year) val ordinalDate = \"2020-365\" . toDate ( DateTimeParsers . Extended . ORDINAL_DATE )","title":"Predefined Parsers"},{"location":"basics/parsing/#custom-parsers","text":"In an ideal world, non-ISO formats wouldn\u2019t exist, but sometimes they do and you need to parse them. To support that, you can define custom parsers using a DSL. // Define a custom parser val customParser = dateTimeParser { monthNumber () anyOf ({ + '/' }, { + '-' }) dayOfMonth () optional { anyOf ({ + '/' }, { + '-' }) year () } } // Parse a date using it try { val date = \"3/17/2020\" . toDate ( customParser ) } catch ( e : DateTimeException ) { // ... } When dealing with ranges and intervals, you'll need to define a \"grouped\" parser, which can handle multiple results. val customGroupedParser = groupedDateTimeParser { group { childParser ( customParser ) } + \"--\" group { childParser ( customParser ) } } val dateRange = \"3/17/2020--4/5/2020\" . toDateRange ( customGroupedParser )","title":"Custom Parsers"},{"location":"extensions/parcelize/","text":"@Parcelize \u00b6 The parcelize-extensions artifact provides a set of parcelers for use with the Parcelable implementation generator in the Kotlin Android Extensions.
